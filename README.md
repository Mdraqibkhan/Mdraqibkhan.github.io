**PhD Candidate @ Trinity College Dublin, Ireland**  
**Research Focus: Computer Vision & Graphics**  

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Trinity College Dublin, specializing in **Stereo Matching** and **Depth Estimation** for advanced robotics, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR) applications. My research addresses critical challenges in **3D reconstruction** and **autonomous driving**, focusing on improving the real-time performance of deep learning models in these domains. Under the supervision of [**Subrahmanyam Murala** (TCD)](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~muralas/), [**Peter Corcoran** (UoG)](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/science-engineering/staff-profiles/petercorcoran/), and [**Carol O’Sullivan** (TCD)](https://www.tcd.ie/scss/people/academic-staff/osullica/), my goal is to develop lightweight deep learning models that enhance the accuracy and efficiency of depth estimation systems.

### AI-Based Ball and Wicket Detection with Pitch Mapping and Impact Analysis in Cricket"

  **Project Summary:**  This project focuses on developing an computer vision model to detect the cricket ball and wicket in real time, map the pitch, and accurately identify the ball's impact point after being thrown. Using advanced computer vision techniques, the model tracks the ball’s trajectory, determines the exact landing spot on the pitch, and assesses interactions with the wicket. This information provides insights into ball behavior, such as bounce and spin, which are critical for performance analysis and strategic planning. The project aims to enhance decision-making in cricket through precise ball tracking and pitch analytics.
